INDEX FULL SCAN 
- all the rows of the tables are indexed by their indexes 
- when optimizer uses the index full scan ? 
	+ query has ORDER BY clause only with the indexed columns 
		. reading whole index (sorted) then read the table 
		  faster >>>> read the whole table then sorted
			.. must write index order by it have 
			example: 
			CREATE INDEX PROD_CUST_IDX ON SALES (PROD_ID, CUST_ID) ;
			SELECT PROD_ID, CUST_ID FROM SALES ORDER BY PROD_ID, CUST_ID; -- triggered 
			SELECT PROD_ID, CUST_ID FROM SALES ORDER BY CUST_ID, PROD_ID; -- DONT triggered 
			
	+ query has GROUP BY clause only with the indexed columns 
		. no need to order exactly like ORDER BY 
	+ query requires SORT-MERGE JOIN 
		. ORDER is important, same as ORDER BY
