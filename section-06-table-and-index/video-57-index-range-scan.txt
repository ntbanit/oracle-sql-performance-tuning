INDEX RANGE SCAN -> when there is a bound (example >, <= between and ...) 
- can be for both B-Tree and Bitmap 
- can be apply to unique or non-unique indexes 
- normarlly data stored in ascending ordered 
- if have ORDER BY or GROUP BY with index column, range scan will not do any sort. it's already sorted. it should not have null values 
	+ if it have another column is NOT INDEX, it will be sorted => COST $$ 
- if ORDER BY have DESC keyword, it will read the data in descending order 
- you can create index as descending 
	+ example: CREATE INDEX index_name ON employees(department_id DESC)

- function-based indexes can be accessed as inde3x range scan 

- if wildcard characters are writen on the right, it will perform index range scan 
	+ example : WHERE department_name LIKE 'NAME%'
