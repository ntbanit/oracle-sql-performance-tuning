INDEX SKIP SCAN 
- if where clause dont have indexed columns, optimizer will not use the indexes 

INDEX SKIP SCAN : dont create index from all rows because of costs 

- if the second, third.. column of a composite index is used as an access predicate, the optimizer will consider the INDEX SKIP SCAN 

- Skip the LEAVES OF B-TREE which do not have any chance to have any matching rows 

- Advantages 
	+ Help to reduce number of indexes 
	+ Decrease the index space 
	+ Increases the overall performance by reducing index maintenance 
	
Example : index on (gender, female) 
select * from employees where are between 20 and 30 ; 
-> go to b-tree and skip some intervals
