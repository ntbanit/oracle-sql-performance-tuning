INDEX JOIN SCAN 

- if the combination of multi indexes store the columns of a query, the optimizer jill join them and read the data from that join 

	example: select column1, column2 from table1 ; -- (column1 is indexed1, column2 is indexed2) => may have INDEX JOIN SCAN 

+ the combination of indexes must have every column of the select clause ?? 
	example:
+ there is no join limit. more than 2 indexes can be joined 
+ there might be any index access path before INDEX JOIN SCAN 
+ if you write ROWID in the select clause, it will NOT perform IJ-Scan
