FULL TABLE SCAN 

some cases, when NOT SELECTIVE, read full table may faster than index 
cuz 
1. a block usually have data of the same table 
	-> read WHOLE BLOCK faster I/O 
2. blocks will be in same TABLESPACE (close to each other and link) 
	-> read WHOLE TABLE will be faster if need more data in this (example : 88%) 


but when need only 1% or 5% data in table -> use index will be faster 

REASON TO CHOOSE FULL TABLE SCAN 
- if there is no suitable index 
- if the selectivity is low 
- if the table is very small (even if there is a index) 
- if full table scan hint is used
