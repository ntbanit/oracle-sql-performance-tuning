IN B-TREE INDEX 

YOU ALREADY HOW A BINARY TREE WORKS, FIND A VALUE IN B-TREE IS SIMILAR THING !


- apply when a column is primary key / unique key 
- AND it is guaranteed that the result will return only 1 ROWID ( or 0) 
=> INDEX UNIQUE SCAN 


condition to optimizer choose this access path :
- is it have ALL COLUMNS of are primary key index or unique key index in predicates ? 
- doese it all use with EQUALITY operator?

example: CREATE INDEX PROD_CUST_IDX ON SALES (PROD_ID, CUST_ID) ;
		SELECT PROD_ID, CUST_ID FROM SALES WHERE  PROD_ID = 1 AND CUST_ID = 1;
