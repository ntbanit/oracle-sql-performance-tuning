Definitions - an ACCESS PATH is a way in which a query retrieves rows from the row sources - a ROW SOURCE is a set of rows returned in a step in the execution plan 	+ it can be tables, views, result of join / group operations..	2 main categories- table ACCESS PATH -> 3 	+ Table Acess Full = FULL TABLE SCAN : read whole table and choose values 	+ Table Acess by ROWID : get rows by address of row (row id) 	+ Sample Table Scan (only can enforce manually) : Randomly 		. when table so large, quick than trace whole table  - index ACCESS PATH -> 8 	+ Index Unique Scan = INDEX SCAN UNIQUE -> return only 1 row : usually the most quickly method unless typing directly rowid  		. Example : select * from employee where id = 1 ;	+ Index Range Scan 		. Example : select * from employee where id in (10, 20) ;	+ Index Full Scan : 		. Example : ORDER BY id / GROUP BY id 	+ Index Fast Full Scan : 		. Example : select id from employee ;	+ Index Skip Scan : skip blocks do not have any key 	+ Index Join Scan :	+ Index Organized Tables :	+ Bitmap Acess Path depends on - table size 	+ small ( usually table ACCESS PATH) 	+ big 	WE CAN GUIDE THE OPTIMIZER WHEN IT PICK A WRONG ACCESS PATH
